# CKAN Issues Extension

This extension allows users to to report issues with datasets and resources in
a CKAN instance.

**Current Status:** Alpha

## What it does

Once installed and enabled, the issues extension will make available a per
dataset issue tracker.

The issue tracker user interface can be found at:

    /dataset/{dataset-name-or-id}/issues

You can add an issue at:

    /dataset/{dataset-name-or-id}/issues/add

### Issues API

The issues extension also exposes its functionality as part of the standard [CKAN Action API][api]:

[api]: http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/api/index.html

Specifically:

    /api/3/action/issue_show
    /api/3/action/issue_create
    /api/3/action/issue_update
    /api/3/action/issue_delete
    /api/3/action/issue_search
    /api/3/action/issue_count
    /api/3/action/issue_comment_create
    /api/3/action/issue_report
    /api/3/action/issue_report_clear
    /api/3/action/issue_comment_report
    /api/3/action/issue_comment_report_clear

## Installation

To install the plugin, enter your virtualenv and install the source::

    pip install git+http://github.com/okfn/ckanext-issues

Create the necessary tables:

    paster --plugin=ckanext-issues issues init_db -c ckan.ini

This will also register a plugin entry point, so you now should be
able to add the following to your CKAN .ini file::

    ckan.plugins = issues

After you clear your cache and reload the site, the Issues plugin
and should be available.

## Configuration

To configure notifications, you should set the following option in your
configuration, and all users in the group will get the email.

    ckanext.issues.send_email_notifications = true

If you set max_strikes then users can 'report' a comment as spam/abuse. If the number of users reporting a particular comment hits the max_strikes number then it is hidden, pending moderation.

    ckanext.issues.max_strikes = 2

## Upgrade from older versions

Should there be any sites running a version of ckanext-issues code from before 9th December 2015, then you need to be aware there were considerable model changes around then e.g. commit https://github.com/datagovuk/ckanext-issues/commit/88ad77a3

No automatic migration is provided - feel free to add one to this repo if you have any issues needing migration. Otherwise, delete the issue tables, create them again:

    psql ckan_default -c 'drop table issue_comment; drop table issue;'
    paster --plugin=ckanext-issues issues init_db -c ckan.ini


### Activation

By default, issues are enabled for all datasets. If you wish to restrict
issues to specific datasets or organizations, you can use these config options:
    
    ckanext.issues.enabled_for_datasets = mydataset1 mydataset2 ...
    ckanext.issues.enabled_for_organizations = department-of-transport health-regulator

Alternatively, you can switch issues on/off for particular datasets by using an extra field:

    'issues_enabled': True

and you can set the default for all the other datasets (without that extra field):

    ckanext.issues.enabled_without_extra = false

For the extra field to work you must not set `enabled_per_dataset` or `enabled_for_organizations` options.

## Feedback

Please open an issue in the github [issue tracker][issues].

## Developers

Normal requirements for CKAN Extensions (including an installation of CKAN and
its dev requirements).

### Testing with Postgres
To run full production tests on postgres run. These are the tests that the travis build will run

    nosetests --ckan --with-pylons=test.ini -v --with-id ckanext/issues --with-coverage --cover-package=ckanext.issues --nologcapture

### Testing with sqlite
For quick development tests run. --reset-db is necessary when running sqlite tests in memory

    nosetests --reset-db --ckan --with-pylons=test-sqlite.ini -v --with-id ckanext/issues --with-coverage --cover-package=ckanext.issues --nologcapture
